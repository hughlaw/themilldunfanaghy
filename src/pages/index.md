    The Mill  reached a new chapter in 2020, offering the best place to stay if
    you want to bridge the gap between a large hotel and a B&B.


    A home from home, we offer seven individual rooms that range from cosy to cavernous.


    Start the day with our award winning breakfast, relax in our many lounge areas and with our extensive local knowledge, we can show you why we think this hidden corner of Donegal is the best place to be.
  openingDatesText: We are open from March until November, weekends only during low season.

    Our rooms at The Mill are named after our local townlands with the exception
    of The Studio, which was Susan's grandfather, Frank Egginton's painting
    studio.


    We hope we have created a warm homely feel, a place to relax, unwind and recharge.


    From our carefully curated Antiques, Egginton paintings, books and furniture, all our bedrooms are unique.

    Of course, they all feature TV's, heavenly mattresses, complimentary wifi
    but its the wee added touches that make the difference.


    A welcome drink , complimentary water, wine, homemade oaties for your room and fresh milk when you want it. Our larger rooms also have a Nepresso machine.

    We now welcome our canine friends to The Mill.  With such great walks in the
    area it seems a shame to leave your dog at home which is why we have two
    rooms where we allow dogs to stay.


    Our dogs are very much part of our life here and so your dog is more than welcome at The Mill. As we have only two doggy friendly rooms please email to book. With notice we will provide walking information, dog water/food bowls,  drying towel, lead and poo bags. Please bring your own bedding . We have a large safe garden for the early morning exercise. We ask you to keep your dog on the lead inside the house and only in the conservatory downstairs.

  aboutUsText2: >-
    The Mill was bought in 1949 by Susan's Grandfather, Frant Egginton, a famous
    watercolour artist.


    He converted the flax mill into his studio and home until his death in 1990.


    Work began in 1999 to modernise and enlarge the house to accommodate a restaurant, 6 ensuite rooms and a living area. In 2001 another room,  The Studio, was added.


    Our new chapter begins in 2020.
