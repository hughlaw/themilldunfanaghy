introduction:
  The Mill has reached a new chapter in 2020, offering the best place to stay if you want to bridge the gap between a large hotel and a B&B.

  A home from home, we offer seven individual rooms that range from cosy to cavernous.
  Start the day with our award winning breakfast, relax in our many lounge areas and with our extensive local knowledge, we can show you why we think this hidden corner of Donegal is the best place to be.

  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.
description: >-
  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.
