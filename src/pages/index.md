    The Mill has reached a new chapter in 2020, offering the best place to stay
    if you want to bridge the gap between a large hotel and a B&B.


    A home from home, we offer seven individual rooms that range from cosy to
    cavernous.


    Start the day with our award winning breakfast, relax in our many lounge
    areas and with our extensive local knowledge, we can show you why we think
    this hidden corner of Donegal is the best place to be.
  openingDatesText: We are open from March until November.

    Our rooms at The Mill are named after our local townlands with the exception
    of The Studio, which was Susan's grandfather, Frank Egginton's painting
    studio.


    We hope we have created a warm homely feel, a place to relax, unwind and
    recharge.


    From our carefully curated Antiques, Egginton paintings, books and
    furniture, all our bedrooms are unique.


    We now welcome our canine friends to The Mill.  With such great walks in the
    area it seems a shame to leave your dog at home which is why we have two
    rooms where we allow dogs to stay.  Doggy  Guidelines can be viewed in more
    detail below.

    Of course, they all feature TV's, heavenly mattresses, complimentary wifi
    but its the wee added touches that make the difference.


    A welcome with coffee and homebaking, complimentary water, wine, homemade
    oaties for your room and fresh milk when you want it. Our larger rooms also
    have a Nepresso machine.

  aboutUsText2: >-
    The Mill was bought in 1949 by Susan's Grandfather, Frant Egginton, a famous
    watercolour artist.


    He converted the flax mill into his studio and home until his death in 1990.


    Work began in 1999 to modernise and enlarge the house to accommodate a
    restaurant, 6 ensuite rooms and a living area. In 2001 another room,  The
    Studio, was added.


    Our new chapter begins in 2020.
