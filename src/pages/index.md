  introText: The Mill has reached a new chapter in 2020, offering the best place to stay if you want to bridge the gap between a large hotel and a B&B.

  A home from home, we offer seven individual rooms that range from cosy to cavernous.

  Start the day with our award winning breakfast, relax in our many lounge areas and with our extensive local knowledge, we can show you why we think this hidden corner of Donegal is the best place to be.
