Susan and Derek are no strangers to the hospitality world having spent 20 years creating and running their award winning restaurant with rooms. They have now turned their attention to providing a very special place to stay.

With so much on offer on our doorstep we hope you love this area as much as we do.

##The story of The Mill
The Mill was bought in 1949 by Susan's Grandfather, Frant Egginton, a famous watercolour artist.

He converted the flax mill into his studio and home until his death in 1990.

Work began in 1999 to modernise and enlarge the house to accommodate a restaurant, 6 ensuite rooms and a living area. In 201another room,  The Studio, was added.

Our new chapter begins in 2020.
