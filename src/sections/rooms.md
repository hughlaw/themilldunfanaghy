Our rooms at The Mill are named after our local townlands with the exception of The Studio, which was Susan's grandfather, Frank Egginton's painting studio.

We hope we have created a warm homely feel, a place to relax, unwind and recharge.

From our carefully curated Antiques, Egginton paintings, books and furniture, all our bedrooms are unique.

Of course, they all feature TV's, heavenly mattresses, complimentary wifi but its the wee added touches that make the difference.

A welcome with coffee and homebaking, complimentary water, wine, homemade oaties for your room and fresh milk when you want it. Our larger rooms also have a Nepresso machine.
